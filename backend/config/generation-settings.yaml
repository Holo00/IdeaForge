idea_generation_prompt: >
  You are an expert at generating comprehensive software business ideas. Generate a new, specific, well-researched
  software business idea using the following framework and constraints.

  **Generation Framework**: {framework_name} {framework_description} {framework_template} {framework_example}

  **Constraints**: - Domain: {domain} - Problem Type: {problem} - Solution Type: {solution} {extra_filters}

  **Evaluation Criteria** (each scored 1-10): {criteria}

  ---

  Generate a unique, viable idea that addresses a real problem in the specified domain. For each evaluation criterion,
  provide 2-3 follow-up questions with detailed answers that demonstrate deep thinking about the idea.

  Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format: ```json {

    "domain": "Parent Domain → Subdomain",
    "problem": "Brief problem description",
    "solution": "Brief solution description",
    "quickSummary": "1-2 sentence elevator pitch explaining the value proposition",

    "concreteExample": {
      "currentState": "Detailed description of how users handle this problem today (2-3 sentences with specific pain points)",
      "yourSolution": "Step-by-step walkthrough of how they would use your solution (2-3 sentences)",
      "keyImprovement": "Quantifiable improvements with specific metrics (time saved, cost reduction, etc.)"
    },

      "technology": "Core tech stack needed (e.g., 'React/Node.js web app + OpenAI API + Stripe')",
      "marketSize": "Market size category with numbers (e.g., 'Mid-Market (500K potential users, $50M TAM)')"
    },

    {evaluation_schema},

    "quickNotes": {
      "strengths": [
        "3-5 bullet points highlighting the strongest aspects of this idea",
        "Focus on unique advantages, market opportunity, clear ROI, etc."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "3-5 bullet points identifying potential risks and challenges",
        "Be honest about gaps, competition, complexity, etc."
      ],
      "keyAssumptions": [
        "3-5 critical assumptions this idea depends on",
        "What needs to be true for this to succeed?"
      ],
      "nextSteps": [
        "3-5 actionable validation steps to test this idea quickly",
        "Include research, interviews, prototypes, etc."

        "Include market size, competitor info, research citations, etc."
      ]
    },

    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3", "tag4", "tag5"]
  } ```

  IMPORTANT: - All {criteria_count} evaluation criteria MUST have exactly 3 questions with detailed answers - Quick
  notes sections MUST have 3-5 items each (strengths, weaknesses, assumptions, next steps, references) - Use specific
  numbers, metrics, and evidence throughout - Be realistic and honest in scoring - not everything should be 8-10 -
  Provide actionable insights that help evaluate if this idea is worth pursuing
