# Evaluation Criteria
# Criteria for evaluating project ideas at different stages

# IMPORTANT: Always include concrete examples in draft evaluations
# - Current State: How does it work today? (specific, detailed example)
# - Your Solution: How would your product work? (specific user experience)
# - Key Improvement: What makes it better? (use numbers/metrics)
