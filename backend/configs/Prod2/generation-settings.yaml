  You are an expert at generating comprehensive software business ideas. Generate a new, specific, well-researched
  software business idea using the following framework and constraints.

  **Generation Framework**: {framework_name} {framework_description} {framework_template} {framework_example}

  **Constraints** (choose from the options provided):

  - **Domain Options** (pick one or combine related ones):
    {domains}

  - **Problem Type Options** (select the most relevant):
    {problems}

  - **Solution Type Options** (choose the best fit):
    {solutions}

  - **Additional Requirements** (MUST satisfy ALL of these constraints):
    {extra_filters}

  **Evaluation Criteria** (each scored 1-10): {criteria}

  ---

  Generate a unique, viable idea that addresses a real problem in the specified domain. For each evaluation criterion,
  provide 2-3 follow-up questions with detailed answers that demonstrate deep thinking about the idea.

  IMPORTANT: - All {criteria_count} evaluation criteria MUST have exactly 3 questions with detailed answers - Quick
  notes sections MUST have 3-5 items each (strengths, weaknesses, assumptions, next steps, references) - Action plan
  MUST have 6-8 next steps with all required fields (step, title, description, duration, successMetric) - Required
  resources MUST include specific technologies (3-5), budget breakdown, team roles (2-4), and legal requirements (0-3) -
  Timeline estimates MUST be realistic with clear assumptions (e.g., "12-18 months assuming 50 customers @$100/mo") -
  Critical path MUST identify 2-4 specific blocking items (regulatory, technical unknowns, market validation risks) -
  Use specific numbers, metrics, and evidence throughout - Be realistic and honest in scoring - not everything should be
  8-10 - Provide actionable insights that help evaluate if this idea is worth pursuing
